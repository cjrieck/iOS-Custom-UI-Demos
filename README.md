App containing a collection of demo UIs

Please feel free to fork and add your own custom UI elements!

How to Contribute
===================

- Create a Group in the Demo group and name it the name of your UI demo
- Treat this Group as your 'Application' group. Add all of your classes in here.
- Create a "View Controllers" Group within your new Group and put the view controllers in here. You can then adhere to whatever file structure you want. Only this has to be fixed.
- Make sure the initial view controller for your demo has the substring 'Base' in it. This is used to determine the initial view. Put this in the 'View Controllers' Group
- Run and Test
